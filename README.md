Rock Paper Scissors coded by Samuel So, July 27 2024

This game was an headache at the first place.
But the process was fun when something starts to make sense and work.

The most challenging part I would say is to make each part of the function trigger the way I wanted it to be.

addEventListener is a fun tool to use.

Math.floo(Math.random() is also a new thing to get on hand.

The use of how to make use of the values inside the function.

The if statement arguments are wonderful to learn.

Thw while loop changed the difficulty of looking for a way to store the scores.

And then the way of learning how to do psudocodecode and making clear comments are also a whole new experience.

My favourite part would be debugging.
When I first wrote the first phase of code it was able to run but there were a lot of problems, like alert reoccuring without consolelogging the value. 
And so I deleted the whole code and re-write again. 
Which was pretty torturing. As I will have to think again.
But then when the basics are done, it is the moment to think about how to link them up, so all I need is one trigger to activate the whole game.

So as to speak, the most frustrating bug I came across.
The input value would end up triggering the "Wrong Choice" argument. I looked up every where, couldn't figure out the problem.
And then the second day, I was improving the efficiency of the code. I was curious what the Math.floor(Math.random()) output was. I consolelog it and found out the numbers were always 1, 2, 3 but never 0. This is where I found the bug was the computer was not able to choose index 0 value, instead returning an unknown index 3 value, that causes the bug.
